Welcome to the world of medical recovery.

Only an hour or so under the knife, and it takes weeks to recover. That's where I'm at. Since I'm in no condition to - say - work with power tools, I decided to start fiddling with websites and whatnot. You know, low impact hobby-type stuff.

Also, I discovered that I had an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/careman71/) account that I didn't know I had. So I posted a couple photos there. But honestly, I'm also not in a position to walk around and take photos, and there's only so many pictures I can take of my bullet journal or bed clothes. So, why not see what I can get up to on the Interwebs? 

I've decided to create this place [careys.space](http://www.careys.space) and learn some new stuff (specifically, the [Jekyll static page editor](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted at github... for *free*. I know: the **.space** domain is supposed to be for stuff related to, well, space and astronomy and whatnot. But it's also nice to have your own *space*, right? Plus, it was literally only $.86 to register (that includes the ICANN fee). Thanks NameCheap!

It's a nice challenge to exercise the old brain muscles after weeks of consuming YouTube pap. Idk if blogging is really my thing, but watch this space if you care. Cheers!
